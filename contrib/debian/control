Package: bitbeand
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Bitbean is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 By default connects to DNS seeders (stalk1.bitbean.org, stalk2.bitbean.org, stalk3.bitbean.org) to discover other peers - in addition to hard-coded clients within the source.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 2+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides bitbeand, a combined daemon and CLI tool to
 interact with the daemon.
